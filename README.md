# Rubik's Cube

A simple Rubik's cube simulator with console interface and 3D graphics implemented using OpenGL 3.3

Note that for solution a genetic algorithm is used, which is not reasonable (yet amusing) approach to the Rubik's Cube puzzle and hence finds far-from-optimal solution in relatively long time
